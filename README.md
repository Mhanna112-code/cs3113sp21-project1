# cs3113sp21-project1
Code to simulate a CPU scheduling algorithm.
BUGS: The code does not correctly calculate all possible cases of waiting time and turnaround time. Most likely a flaw in the logic of the code.
Libraries: The code uses <stdio.h> which allows printing and file reading.
The code reads in input from a file given in command line argument.
Example usage:
Assuming we have an input file sample.txt, compile the program and enter ./project1 sample.txt into the command line to input the file as an argument into the program.
